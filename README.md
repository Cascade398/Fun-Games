# Fun-Games
Just simple fun Javascript games. I made it because I was bored and they always wanted "projects" which are time-consuming and needs too much reading. Plus these are games, who don't find games fun?

The current games in this repository:
1. Breakout
2. A simple RGB Color Game.
3. Minesweeper.
4. Snake
